Pantheon is an experimental game framework -- which is to say that the concepts introduced in Pantheon are experimental.

They may feel strange and uncomfortable if you're used to normal game frameworks, but the goal is to make something different, interesting, and -- hopefully -- beautiful.

Soon, this file will house a brief overview of the philosophy of Pantheon, some example code, and links to more information.
