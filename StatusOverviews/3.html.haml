%h1 Overview
%p A pretty good week, although it was totally not what I expected. Project management data coming soon.

%h2 Boo Adventure
%p
  To design the programming language part of the project, I'm using an existing language called Boo. It's open source, pre-1.0, and under active development, so things are fairly volatile.
  I ran into an issue in the latest official release that probably would've prevented me from doing some of the cooler language features I was planning. I spent a day developing a workaround,
  but it still wasn't quite what I needed. I asked the Boo mailing list, and the main Boo developer replied in a few hours with a new version that does exactly what I wanted.
%p
  That was great, but it's not in an official release yet, so that also meant that I had to update my project to target the latest Boo. Changing dependencies is always a pain, and targeting
  bleeding-edge Boo also introduces risk into my project, so I have mixed feelings, but I don't really have a choice until an official release comes out.

%h2 Architectural Whiteboard Fun Time

%p
  In an effort to be more "visual", and to work out an unknown that's been bothering me since the start of the project, I diagrammed the framework on a whiteboard.
%p
  Pantheon keeps the game logic and the visual representation of the game state as two separate domains. It does this because of a common design principle known as Model-View-Controller.
  I could go into detail about what MVC is, and why it's a good thing, but essentially it's a way of simplifying a problem by cutting along clear boundaries.
%p
  Traditionally, in MVC, the view is essentially a wrapper around one or more models, and it presents information about the model to the user. There are two pitfalls with MVC as it relates
  to game development. One is that it is too easy to "cheat" and mix your view in with your model. The other is that you need a controller to coordinate their interaction otherwise the relationship
  is hard to maintain. But the controller itself can be hard to maintain, and a lot of extra work for no gain in functionality.
%p
  So Pantheon does away with the controller, replacing it with a message system in which views and models both speak the same language but can't cheat by peeking at each other's information.
%p
  The problem was in how to connect this low-level philosophical toy into a rendering system in a way that made sense. I had figured out that I wanted to model the UI separately and have the
  only cross-over point be a special kind of widget called a Viewport, but then I realized that other UI components often tie into the game state. Something as simple as a score counter needs to
  have privileged knowledge of the game rules, and while that could technically be solved by hooking into the message system directly, I wanted a better solution.
%p
  After I drew up this diagram and talked it over with Josh Morgan for at least an hour, I had a Eureka moment: I've got a widget (the Viewport) that I'm saying is special because it's
  responsible for the visual representation of game objects... but can't any widget represent game data, even if it's something intangible like the player's score? Clearly, the UI can't be
  isolated from Pantheon's inner workings -- the two are just intrinsically connected.

%h2 The Good
%ul
  %li Figured out a sweet way to describe UI elements that allows the user to easily define their own.
  %li Implemented some basic widgets using the new UI system.
  %li Automated building and installation of Pantheon and its dependencies.
  %li Solved a pretty big architectural question.

%h2 The Bad
%ul
  %li
    Ran into a limitation in how Boo handles macros that use class keywords like "override", which I spent a day trying to work around but ultimately asked the Boo mailing list for help.
    The main Boo developer responded and implemented exactly the functionality I was looking for in just a few hours.
  %li
    That new Boo functionality meant that I had to switch to using the latest Boo, which ate a lot of time, but I automated the process as I went so it's not a pain if I have to do the
    same thing again later.
  %li I finally broke down and tried Minecraft: The Productivity Killer.
  %li Also I'm sick, and trying to finish a project at work.
