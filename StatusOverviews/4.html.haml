%h1 Overview
%p I've started implementing what we came up with last week in the whiteboard session, but I've been sick and wrapping up an iPhone app at work, so progress has been slow.

%h2 The Good
%ul
  %li I've got the screen system more or less how I want it.
  %li My work schedule for the rest of the semester looks a lot less stressful, which should allow me to spend more time on my project.

%h2 The Bad
%ul
  %li Lack of time this past week.
  %li
    I stole time away from project management duties so that I could at least get one feature done for this week.
    This means that I don't have a good gauge on where I am, except to say that I'm behind.
