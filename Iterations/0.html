Status Report from Engineering
<h2>Terminology</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Points: Abstract units of time, risk, uncertainty; complex things have high point values</li>
  <li>Velocity: How many points are completed per iteration, on average</li>
  <li>Story: A small feature, usually something that takes less than a day; estimated in terms of points</li>
  <li>Iteration: Unit of time used for project management; one week</li>
</ul>
