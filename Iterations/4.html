<h2>About</h2>
<p>
  Pantheon is a game framework that does something radically simple: it describes game worlds in game terms rather than code terms.
  It has a special emphasis on expressive language, and testability. Pantheon runs on Mono, and therefore can be used by any CLR
  language, including C#, but the most powerful features require Boo. Boo is a CLR dialect of Python, used by Unity, with a powerful
  macro system that allows the language to be taught new things.

<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>I've started implementing what we came up with last week in the whiteboard session, but I've been sick and wrapping up an iPhone app at work, so progress has been slow.</p>
<h2>The Good</h2>
<ul>
  <li>I've got the screen system more or less how I want it.</li>
  <li>My work schedule for the rest of the semester looks a lot less stressful, which should allow me to spend more time on my project.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Bad</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Lack of time this past week.</li>
  <li>
    I stole time away from project management duties so that I could at least get one feature done for this week.
    This means that I don't have a good gauge on where I am, except to say that I'm behind.
