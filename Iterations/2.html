<h2>About</h2>
<p>
  Pantheon is a game framework that does something radically simple: it describes game worlds in game terms rather than code terms.
  It has a special emphasis on expressive language, and testability. Pantheon runs on Mono, and therefore can be used by any CLR
  language, including C#, but the most powerful features require Boo. Boo is a CLR dialect of Python, used by Unity, with a powerful
  macro system that allows the language to be taught new things.
